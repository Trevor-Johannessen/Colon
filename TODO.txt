Testing:
Test menu to make sure it works with the new program
Test printable text in button and menu

Old Objects:
	All:
		Redo object structure so everything is wrapped in pcall for better error handeling
	General:
		Replace standard text printing in objects with new Text Objects
	Menu:
		Update Menu to allow for it to be selected
	Text:
		NOTE: MAY BE BETTER IDEA TO CREATE NEW textbox: OBJECT
		-separate aprint into 2 separate printing commands
			aprint: (MAIN IDEA: lightweight simple text that should not lag the page)
				-colored text
				-textbox dimensions (text outside of the box will NOT be rednered
				-textbox border (if border is on)
			newaprint: (MAIN IDEA: This will be interactable and thus more resource intensive)
				-everything aprint: has
				-variable replacement
				-hyperlink text
				-if textbox dimensions are given and text overflows outside then box becomes scrollable
	Scroll:
		fix wrap around text for scroll:, similar to text: fix	
	Sprite:
		Add check to only draw when on screen and only draw what's one screen
	Var:
		Figure out how to implement string var substitution without breaking the program if Var isnt there.
	Button:
		add direct execution of commands on activation (remove need for when statement) (NEEDS TESTING)
		add solid color presets
		add default color inversion for on black (for button color and text color)
	Scroll:
		Add length option
	Textbox:
		Finish textbox text parsing for enter
		Add ability to submit textbox text to a function on key press
		
New Objects:
	Gif - Object to implement sequential .pgi files
	Slider - slide bar that can have N notches. 

Functions:
	NewPage - Goes to a new page by running the initalization function on a new file
	NewTab - creates a new tab and runs colon on a file

Properties:


Utilities:
	Debug mode - version of colon that outputs to rednet to be read by a reciever
	Debug reciever - program to take input from debug colon and provide a console

Instruction:
	Write tutorial on how to write in language
	Write entry on all objects and properties
	Write tutorial on how to implement and expand the interpreter

Bugs:
	Cant correctly comment out when statements since they have 2 colons
